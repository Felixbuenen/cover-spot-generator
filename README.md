# Unreal Engine 4 - Cover Spot Generator

The UE4 cover spot generator generates cover point data dynamically based on the navigation mesh in the scene.
There are several generation parameters (such as "maximum number of cover points per navigation edge") that allow the user to adjust cover point generation to their needs.
Moreover, an EQS generator along with specific EQS cover point tests have been developed so that users can work with the powerful EQS tool.

This repository contains the code for the generator as well as example maps that demonstrate how the generator might be used. For more information on the project,
